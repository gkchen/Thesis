abstract = {Radiative lifetimes for vibrationally excited ground state HCO+ions have been determined in a triple-cell FT-ICR spectrometer using the proton transfer reactions with HBr, N2O, HCl, CH4, CO2and NO to probe the time evolution of HCO+internal energy. With HBr, N2O, HCl and CH4two sets of lifetimes are obtained; the long ones (359-50 ms) are assigned to the bending mode levels, and the short ones (10-30 ms) to the CH and CO stretching modes. Correction of the observed lifetimes for collisional quenching is discussed in detail. A simple model has been used to simulate the influence of the radiative cascade. The experimental lifetimes obtained for the bending mode levels are in good agreement with the simulated lifetimes. For the fast components the experimental uncertainty is too large to allow any conclusion to be drawn about the lifetime of the individual stretching modes. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Based on this implementation, we show that infrequent energetic collisions of single ions with background gas molecules lead to pronounced heating of the entire ion ensemble and a time-varying secular ensemble temperature which manifests itself in a superstatistical time-averaged velocity distribution of the ions. The effect of this finding on the experimental determination of ion temperatures and rate constants for cold chemical reactions is discussed.},

There is no evidence that the size of the ion has an appreciable effect on the magnitude of the proton transfer rate, at least within the accuracy of the ICR experiments.

Given this ubiquity, there is a worldwide effort to improve the efficiency and resolution of mass spectrometers. However, the performance of all techniques is ultimately limited by the initial phase-space distribution of the molecules being analyzed. Here, we dramatically reduce the width of this initial phase-space distribution by sympathetically cooling the input molecules with laser-cooled, co-trapped atomic ions, improving both the mass resolution and detection efficiency of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer by over an order of magnitude.

abstract = {A classical theory for the ion‐permanent dipole interaction is developed that takes into consideration the thermal rotational energy of the polar molecule. The theory is formulated in terms of an r‐dependent average orientation angle (r) between the dipole and the line of centers of collision. The technique allows quantitative determination of the capture cross section as a function of ion‐polar molecule relative velocity. In addition, capture limit rate constants are readily calculated both at thermal energies and as a function of relative energy. Charge transfer rate constants from various rare gas ions to difluorobenzene and dichloroethylene isomers have been measured at thermal energies using ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy. Rate constants are considerably larger than predicted by the capture theories for both polar and nonpolar isomers indicating long range electron jump is a prevalent mechanism for charge transfer in these systems. The average‐dipole‐orientation theory developed in this paper adequately accounts for the effects of the permanent dipole moment on the rate constant.},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Studying chemical reactions at very low temperatures is of importance for the under-standing of fundamental physical and chemical processes. At very low energies, collisions are dominated by only a few partial waves. Thus, studies in this regime allow the character-ization of quantum effects which depend on the collisional angular momentum, e.g., reactive scattering resonances and tunneling through centrifugal barriers. Additionally, the dynamics of ultralow-energy collisions is dominated by long-range interactions, i.e., " universal " chemi-cal forces. Thus, experiments in this domain probe the details of intermolecular interactions which is of general relevance for the understanding of chemical processes. Moreover, the increasingly more precise experiments provide valuable data for benchmarking theoretical models and quantum-chemical calculations. Studies of cold ion-neutral reactions in the laboratory rely on techniques for the generation of cold ions and cold neutrals. Over the last decades, the technology in this domain has made impressive progress. Many of these techniques do not only allow the translational cooling of the molecules, but also a precise preparation of their internal quantum state. Thus, by an accurate preparation of both the energy and state of the reaction partners as well as by the application of external electric, magnetic or optical fields, prospects open up to study and control chemical processes at an unprecedented level of accuracy. In this chapter, we will review salient theoretical concepts and recent experimental developments for studies of ion-molecule reactions at low temperatures. We first discuss the theoretical background for the description of low-energy ion-molecule reactions. Next we present key experimental methods for laboratory studies of cold ion-molecule reactions. The chapter concludes with a review of illustrative results and an outlook on future directions.},

abstract = {We demonstrate photodissociation of BeH + ions within a Coulomb crystal of thousands of 9 Be + ions confined in a Penning trap. Because BeH + ions are created via exothermic reactions between trapped, laser-cooled Be + (2 P 3/2) and background H 2 within the vacuum chamber, they represent a major contaminant species responsible for infidelities in large-scale trapped-ion quantum-information experiments. The rotational-state-insensitive dissociation scheme described here makes use of 157-nm photons to produce Be + and H as products, thereby restoring Be + ions without the need for reloading. This technique facilitates longer experiment runtimes at a given background H 2 pressure and may be adapted for removal of MgH + and AlH + impurities. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.91.011401 PACS number(s): 33.80.Gj, 37.10.−x, 03.67.−a, 52.27.Jt Crystals of laser-cooled atomic ions form the basis of many experimental realizations of quantum logic gates [1–3] and simulations of quantum many-body physics [4–6]. In room-temperature vacuum systems, collisions with neutral background gas molecules limit quantum coherences and quantum logic operations [7]. Here we focus on inelastic (i.e., reactive) collisions where exothermic chemical reactions with background gas molecules can generate, in both Penning and radiofrequency (rf) traps, cotrapped molecular ions over a wide range of trapping conditions and crystal geometries [6–9]. These contaminants alter ion-crystal eigenfrequencies and can complicate quantum logic interactions [10]. Impurities may be resonantly ejected from both rf and Penning traps, but this technique is least efficient when the impurities are similar in mass to the qubit ion [11]. The rate of impurity ion formation increases linearly with the number of ion qubits in the register and the time required for loading new ions and recalibrating the register increases with the size of the system. Therefore, experimental techniques to prevent or reverse qubit-ion chemistry will be a key tool for many-ion quantum-information platforms. In this Rapid Communication we experimentally demonstrate a rotationally insensitive pho-todissociation (PD) technique for BeH + accumulated within a 9 Be + Coulomb crystal.

The theory utilizes a framework similar to the average dipole orientation (ADO) theory developed previously. The AQO theory indicates that there is a significant increase in the capture rate constant (0-40%) for molecules with large quadrupole moments and small polarizabilities. Empirical formulas have been obtained which permit determination of the thermal energy capture limit rate constants by making simple calculations. Thermal energy proton transfer reaction rate constant at 300 K from D3+to a number of quadrupolar molecules have been measured experimentally using ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy. Experimental results are in good agreement with predictions of the AQO theory and are substantially less than predictions of the locked quadrupole theory. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

abstract = {HOC + and CO + have been detected toward two well-known photon-dominated regions (PDRs), S140 and NGC 2023, using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12 m telescope. The J ¼ 1 ! 0 transition of HOC + at 89 GHz and the two spin components of the N ¼ 2 ! 1 line of CO + near 236 GHz were observed, as well as the J ¼ 1 ! 0 transitions of H 13 CO + and HC 18 O + . The J ¼ 3 ! 2 line of HOC + at 268 GHz was also mapped across the Orion Bar. The [ HCO + ]/[ HOC + ] ratios determined in S140 and NGC 2023 were $12,408 and 1913, respectively, values indicative of quiescent molecular gas rather than PDR sources, where the abundance of HOC + is thought to be enhanced. However, the beam in both these measurements may contain material from the adjoining mo-lecular cloud, favoring HCO + . Alternatively, the [ HCO + ]/[ HOC + ] ratio may vary with A v in PDR regions. The [CO + ]/[ HOC + ] ratio in S140 and NGC 2023, at several positions in the Orion Bar, and in other PDRs, on the other hand, falls uniformly in the range $1–10. In addition, the line profiles of CO + and HOC + in the Orion Bar look remarkably similar. The syntheses of HOC + and CO + appear to be correlated in PDRs, most likely through the common precursor, C + . The reaction of C + and H 2 O is thought to preferentially create HOC + , as opposed to HCO + , and C þ þ OH or O 2 leads favorably to CO + .},

abstract = {Cryogenically cooled buffer gas beam sources of the molecule thorium monoxide (ThO) are optimized and characterized. Both helium and neon buffer gas sources are shown to produce ThO beams with high flux, low divergence, low forward velocity, and cold internal temperature for a variety of stagnation densities and nozzle diameters. The beam operates with a buffer gas stagnation density of $\sim$10^15-10^16 cm^-3 (Reynolds number $\sim$1-100), resulting in expansion cooling of the internal temperature of the ThO to as low as 2 K. For the neon (helium) based source, this represents cooling by a factor of about 10 (2) from the initial nozzle temperature of about 20 K (4 K). These sources deliver $\sim$10^11 ThO molecules in a single quantum state within a 1-3 ms long pulse at 10 Hz repetition rate. Under conditions optimized for a future precision spectroscopy application [A C Vutha et al 2010 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 43 074007], the neon-based beam has the following characteristics: forward velocity of 170 m/s, internal temperature of 3.4 K, and brightness of 3x10^11 ground state molecules per steradian per pulse. Compared to typical supersonic sources, the relatively low stagnation density of this source, and the fact that the cooling mechanism relies only on collisions with an inert buffer gas, make it widely applicable to many atomic and molecular species, including those which are chemically reactive, such as ThO.},

abstract = {Sympathetic cooling of trapped ions through collisions with neutral buffer gases is critical to a variety of modern scientific fields, including fundamental chemistry, mass spectrometry, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics. Despite its widespread use over four decades, there remain open questions regarding its fundamental limitations. To probe these limits, here we examine the steady-state evolution of up to ten barium ions immersed in a gas of three-million laser-cooled calcium atoms. We observe and explain the emergence of nonequilibrium behavior as evidenced by bifurcations in the ion steady-state temperature, parameterized by ion number. We show that this behavior leads to limitations in creating and maintaining translationally cold samples of trapped ions using neutral-gas sympathetic cooling. These results may provide a route to studying nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The concept of using a background gas to facilitate the loading of metallic particles into early ion traps was first demonstrated in 1959[1]. Since then, using collisions with cold, chemically-inert gases to sympathetically cool trapped ions has become a general technique in many areas of scien-tific research. Today the sympathetic cooling of ions with neu-tral buffer gases is routinely used to control the energy scales of chemical reactions[2], to improve the performance of com-mercial mass spectrometers[3], and to prepare short-lived ex-otic nuclei for tests of the Standard Model[4]. It has also been proposed as a method to initialize qubits in future quantum computation architecture[5]. Despite the widespread use of sympathetic cooling in ion traps, its kinetics have not yet been completely described and, likewise, its limitations are still not fully understood. The complexity of the cooling process derives from the fact that a system of trapped ions immersed in a cold buffer gas is not an isolated system. Instead, due to the presence of the time-dependent trapping potential, energy is injected and removed from the system over a single trapping cycle. Thus, as it is not a true representation of the canonical ensemble, the trapped ions do not tend to thermal equilibrium with the cold buffer gas as one might expect. As a result, collisions in the ion trap lead to fundamentally nonequilibrium processes which have made it difficult to establish a complete kinetic description of the technique and, as later explained, limits its ability to create and maintain translationally cold temperatures. To probe this nonequilibrium behavior, we characterize the collisional processes between trapped ions and a buffer gas of laser-cooled atoms in a hybrid-atom ion trap. In our con-ception of this apparatus (shown in Fig. 1a), laser-cooled barium ions confined by a linear quadrupole trap (LQT) are immersed in a 4 mK gas of magneto-optically trapped cal-cium atoms. Thus far, relatively little work has been done to fully understand the complex statistical mechanics of these hybrid systems[6–11] despite being critical to current appli-cations such as observing atom-ion collisions and reactions at cold temperatures[7, 12–16] and producing cold molecular ions[17, 18]. Through a more complete understanding of the collisional processes and nonequilibrium phenomena in these systems, which offer precise experimental control, we can es-tablish the general limits of sympathetic cooling ion traps. In what follows, we first present a full description of the sympathetic collisional processes in a hybrid trap and how they lead to the emergence of nonequilibrium behavior. Sec-ond, we provide the results of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation that confirms the emergence of nonequilibrium dy-namics of small numbers of trapped ions in a laser-cooled buffer gas under idealized conditions. Third, we describe an experiment in which we immerse laser-cooled barium ions in a gas of ultracold calcium atoms and observe the hallmark of this nonequilibrium behavior: bifurcation of the ion steady-state temperature as parameterized by trapped ion number. Last, remark on what these findings entail regarding the lim-its of sympathetic cooling of trapped ions with neutral buffer gases, we discuss the implications of the results on current hybrid trap experiments, and expound on ways to engineer fu-ture hybrid traps to tailor more diverse sources of heating and cooling to model a variety of nonequilibrium systems.},

abstract = {? Abstract? This review discusses the reactivities and thermodynamics of small-size-specific transition metal clusters and focuses on thermodynamic information, which has not been comprehensively discussed before. Because of this focus, guided-ion-beam mass spectrometry was used to acquire much of the data. The details of this technique and the associated data analysis methods are provided. Results on the stabilities of bare transition metal clusters are provided for neutral, cationic, and anionic species. Implications for the electronic and geometrical structures are discussed, as well as the extrapolation of these values to bulk phase behavior. Detailed results for reactions of transition metal clusters with D2 and the oxygen donors O2 and CO2 are reviewed. Available bond energies between size-specific clusters and one D atom and one and two O atoms are compiled, and their implications are evaluated and favorably compared with bulk phase analogs. Several additional thermodynamic studies of various cluster systems are also discussed.},

Our current focus is on the reactions of C + , a major cation in the interstellar medium, with the neutrals O 2 , H 2 O, CH 4 , NH 3 and C 2 H 2 . Future planned work includes studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), developing comprehensive pathways for their formation, and identification of those PAHs important to interstellar chemistry. The recent discovery of ISM anions has highlighted the importance of examining mechanisms of anionic chemistry in the interstellar medium, and we plan to obtain data relevant to the formation and destruction processes of molecular anions in space. },

The $\sigma$(000), $\sigma$(111), and $\sigma$(211) values thus obtained reveal rotational enhancements at low Ecm < 0.50 eV, in agreement with the observation of the previous study of the H2O(+)(X(2)B1) + D2 reaction. This Communication presents important progress concerning the high-level ab initio quantum calculation of the potential energy surface for the H2O(+)(X(2)B1) + H2 (D2) reactions, which has provided valuable insight into the origin of the rotational enhancement effect. Governed by the charge and dipole-induced-multipole interactions, the calculation shows that H2 (D2) approaches the H end of H2O(+)(X(2)B1) in the long range, whereas chemical force in the short range favors the orientation of H2 (D2) toward the O side of H2O(+). The reorientation of H2O(+) reactant ion facilitated by rotational excitation thus promotes the H2O(+) + H2 (D2) reaction along the minimum energy pathway, rendering the observed rotational enhancement effects. The occurrence of this effect at low Ecm indicates that the long range charge and dipole-induced-multipole interactions of the colliding pair play a significant role in the dynamics of the exothermic H2O(+) + H2 (D2) reactions.},

This paper reviews the theoretical and experimental progress in research on cold hybrid ion-atom systems which aim to combine the best features of the two well-established fields. We provide a broad overview of the theoretical description of ion-atom mixtures and their applications, and report on advances in experiments with ions trapped in Paul or dipole traps overlapped with a cloud of cold atoms, and with ions directly produced in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We start with microscopic models describing the electronic structure, interactions, and collisional physics of ion-atom systems at low and ultralow temperatures, including radiative and non-radiative charge transfer processes and their control with magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances. Then we describe the relevant experimental techniques and the intrinsic properties of hybrid systems. In particular, we discuss the impact of the micromotion of ions in Paul traps on ion-atom hybrid systems. Next, we review recent proposals for using ions immersed in ultracold gases for studying cold collisions, chemistry, many-body physics, quantum simulation, and quantum computation and their experimental realizations. In the last part we focus on the formation of molecular ions via spontaneous radiative association, photoassociation, magnetoassociation, and sympathetic cooling. We discuss applications and prospects of cold molecular ions for cold controlled chemistry and precision spectroscopy.},

Three transitions of MgNC were observed, each of which consists of two spin-rotation components, and Ðve lines of NaCN were measured ; both detections were made in the 2 mm wavelength region using the NRAO 12 m telescope. Three transitions of AlF were observed as well at 2 and 1.2 mm with the IRAM 30 m antenna. All three species appear to trace the AGB wind, not the high-velocity out{\~{N}}ows characteristic of post-AGB mass loss. Rotational temperature analysis suggests that MgNC emission is from cooler gas than AlF and NaCN, indicating an outer shell distribution for this molecule, as is found in IRC ]10216.

Spin-orbit corrections at the complete active space self-consistent field level are included in both PESs. The spin-orbit corrected ground state PES retains a relatively deep pre-reaction van der Waals well and a “reactant-like” transition state with a classical barrier of 4.2 kcal/mol. The spin-orbit corrected excited state PES has, on the other hand, a very shallow pre-reaction van der Waals complex and a much higher (17.6 kcal/mol) classical barrier, also featuring a “reactant-like” transition state. The adiabatic F + H2O → HF + OH reaction dynamics on these two PESs are investigated using both quasi-classical trajectory and full-dimensional wave packet methods. Both reaction pathways produce internally excited HF and relatively cold OH, consistent with a direct abstraction mechanism. In addition, the spin-orbit corrections on the ground electronic state have a limited impact on the dynamics.},

In addition, rotational excitation of the H 2 O reactant slightly inhibits the reactivity.

The reaction F + H 2 O → HF + OH is a four-atom system that provides an important benchmark for reaction dynamics. Hydrogen atom transfer at the transition state for this reaction is expected to exhibit a strong dependence on reactant vibrational excitation. In the present study, the vibrational effects are examined by photodetachment of vibrationally excited F − (H 2 O) precursor anions using photoelectron-photofragment coincidence (PPC) spectroscopy and compared with full six-dimensional quantum dynamical calculations on ab initio potential energy surfaces. Prior to photodetachment at h$\nu$ UV = 4.80 eV, the overtone of the ionic hydrogen bond mode in the precursor F − (H 2 O), 2 $\nu$ IHB at 2885 cm −1 , was excited using a tunable IR laser. Experiment and theory show that vibrational energy in the anion can be effectively carried away by the photoelectron upon a Franck–Condon photodetachment, and also show evidence for an increase of branching into the F + H 2 O reactant channel. The experimental results suggest a greater role for product rotational excitation than theory. Improved potential energy surfaces and longer wavepacket propagation times would be helpful to further examine the nature of the discrepancy.},

abstract = {Experimental physics is the art of observing the struc-ture of matter and of detecting the dynamic processes within it. But in order to understand the extremely com-plicated behavior of natural processes as an interplay of a few constituents governed by as few as possible funda-mental forces and laws, one has to measure the properties of the relevant constituents and their interaction as pre-cisely as possible. And as all processes in nature are in-terwoven, one must separate and study them individual-ly. It is the skill of the experimentalist to carry out clear experiments in order to get answers to his questions un-disturbed by undesired effects, and it is his ingenuity to improve the art of measuring to ever higher precision. There are many examples in physics showing that higher precision revealed new phenomena, inspired new ideas, or confirmed or dethroned well-established theories. On the other hand, new experimental techniques conceived to answer special questions in one field of physics became very fruitful in other fields, too, be it in chemistry, biolo-gy, or engineering. In awarding the Nobel prize to my colleagues Norman Ramsey, Hans Dehmelt, and me for new experimental methods, the Swedish Academy indi-cates her appreciation for the aphorism the Gottingen physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg wrote two hun-dred years ago in his notebook "one has to do something new in order to see something new. " On the same page Lichtenberg said: "I think it is a sad situation in all our chemistry that we are unable to suspend the constituents of matter free. " Today the subject of my 1ecture will be the suspension of such constituents of rnatter or, in other words, about traps for free charged and neutral particles without ma-terial walls. Such traps permit the observation of isolated particles, even of a single one, over a long period of time and therefore according to Heisenberg's uncertainty prin-ciple enable us to measure their properties with extreme-ly high accuracy. In particular, the possibility to observe individual trapped particles opens up a new dimension in atomic measurements. Until a few years ago all measurements were performed on an ensemble of particles. Therefore the measured value — for example, the transition proba-bility between two eigenstates of an atom — is a value averaged over many particles. Tacitly one assumes that all atoms show exactly the same statistical behavior if one attributes the result to the single atom. On. a trapped *This lecture was delivered 8 December 1989, on the occasion of the presentation of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physics. single atom, however, one can observe its interaction with a radiation field and its own statistical behavior alone. The idea of building traps grew out of molecular-beam physics, mass spectrometry, and particle accelerator physics I was involved in during the first decade of my career as a physicist more than 30 years ago. In these years (1950 — 55) we had learned that plane electric and magnetic multipole fields are able to focus particles in two dimensions acting on the magnetic or electric dipole moment of the particles. Lenses for atomic and molecu-lar beams (Friedburg and Paul, 1951; Bennewitz and Paul, 1954, 1955) were conceived and realized, improving considerably the molecular-beam method for spectrosco-py or for state selection. The lenses found application as well to the ammonia as to the hydrogen maser (Townes, 1983). The question "What happens if one injects charged particles, ions or electrons, in such multipole fields" led to the development of the linear quadrupole mass spec-trometer. It employs not only the focusing and defocus-ing forces of a high-frequency electric quadrupole field acting on ions, but also exploits the stability properties of their equations of motion in analogy to the principle of strong focusing for accelerators which had just been},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {An optical-optical double resonance technique has been used on beryllium ions stored in a Penning trap to measure the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction constant A$\sim$/2 of the 2p P$\sim$g2 level in Be+. The measured value of At$\sim$2=-118.6(3.6) MHz is in good agreement with theoretical calculations. The 2p P fine-structure splitting and the 2s S$\sim$/2 2p P3/2 &/2 optical transition frequencies have also been measured. The 2p P hyperfine structure of the Lit electronic sequence has attracted much theoretical interest over the past two decades (see, for example, Refs. 1-4 and references contained in Ref. 5). This is because of the computational feasibility in a three-electron system, the importance of and interest in polarization and correlation effects, and the availability of good experimental measurements in 7Li. The 3 ]/2 2 3/2 and 3 3/2 $\sim$/2 hypef inc constants of the 2p P state in 7Li have been measured; these constants determine the individual spin-dipolar, orbital, and contact contributions to the 2p P hyperfine structure. Agreement with theoretical calculations is on the order of a few percent. ' Measurements of the A3/2 hyperfine constant of the 2p P state have been made in sBe+ (Ref. 8) and "B2+ (Ref. 9). In sBe+, $\sim$23$\sim$2$\sim$ has been measured to be less than 0.6 MHz. s A Hartree-Pock central field calculation yields the value Q 3/2-=-1 8.7 MHz, but polarization and correlation effects contribute + 17.2 MHz and produce a final value of A 3/2-1 .5 (1.2) MHz in agreement with the expe'rimental measurements. ' Measurements of the A$\sim$/2 and A3/2, I/2 hy-perfine constants of the 2p P state in Be+ are useful for further tests of the theoretical calculations and are needed to determine the individual spin-dipolar, orbital, and contact contributions to the 2p P hyperfine structure. This paper reports the first measurement of the A$\sim$/2 hyperfine constant of the 2p 2P state in 9Be+. The measured value of At(2=-118. 6(3.6) MHz is in agreement with the theoretical calculation of Ref. 1 of-116.8(2.4) MHz. Much of the experimental apparatus used in this measurement has been described in other reports. ' " Be+ ions were confined by the static magnetic and electric fields of a Penning trap in ultrahigh vacuum ((10 $\sim$ Pa). The uniform magnetic field of approximately 1.1 T nearly decoupled the nuclear spin from the total electronic angular momentum. The confining electric field (1 V/cm) had a negligible perturbation (& 1 Hz) on the 2s Sip and 2p PJ energy levels of the ions. The benign environment and long confinement times of electromagnetic traps have been used to make numerous high-precision rf and microwave measurements of the hyperfine structure in the ground state of ions. ' Here, however, an optical measurement of the first excited state hyperfine structure was accomplished by using laser cooling to reduce the ion temperature below a few K so that the hyperfine components of the optical transition were resolved. A narrow-band (& 4 MHz) radiation source (power = 20 p, W) tuned to the low-frequency side of the 2s 2Stg(Mg, Mg) = (-T,-$\sim$) 2p 2P3(2(-$\sim$,-q) ()$\sim$. =313 nm) transition of Be+ was used to cool and spatially compress the ions and optically pump them into the (-T,-T) ground state. " The 313-nm source was obtained by frequency doubling the output of a single-mode cw dye laser. The resonance fluorescence induced by this "cooling" laser was used to detect the ions. " Typical ion "clouds" consisted of at most several hundred ions with cloud densities of 2X 10$\sim$ ions/cm and cloud diameters of 100-300 p, m. The 2p P&$\sim$2 hyperfine structure was measured by an optical-optical double resonance technique with a second frequency-doubled dye laser, denoted the probe laser (power &(1 p, W). '3 When the probe laser was tuned in resonance with the 2s'Si(2(-$\sim$.-$\sim$)-2p'Pig(-z. +» transition (transition A), some of the ion population was removed from the (-$\sim$,-r) ground state. This resulted in a decrease in the observed fluorescence induced by the cooling laser. The 2s 'Si)2(-$\sim$,-$\sim$)-2p 'Pi(2(-$\sim$,-$\sim$) transition (transition B) was detected in a similar way. Radio-frequency (rf) radiation (frequency approximately equal to 300 MHz) tuned to the ground-state (-T,-$\sim$) (-$\sim$,-$\sim$) transition was used to mix the (-r,-$\sim$) and (-$\sim$,-T) ground states. Owing to this rf mixing, a decrease in the fluorescent light intensity was also observed when the probe laser was tuned from the (-$\sim$,-$\sim$) ground state to the 2p Pig2(-$\sim$, + $\sim$) state (transition C). Figure 1 shows the transitions driven by the probe laser. Figure 2(a) shows the depopulation signals obtained when the probe laser was frequency swept through transitions A and C. Part of the probe dye laser beam, before doubling, was picked off and sent into an ' I2 ceil. ' I2 saturated absorption spectra were simultaneously recorded as the probe laser was frequency swept through the optical transitions to the 2p2Pig2 state (see Fig. 2). At the magnetic field used in this experiment, line number 955 of the ' I2 atlas'4 and the next higher-frequency line (uncataloged) approximately coincided with the Be+ transitions to the MJ=-$\sim$ and MJ= + $\sim$ states of the 2p-Pr$\sim$$\sim$/2 manifold, respectively. The frequency differences between the I2 hyperfine components were measured by stabilizing two dye lasers to different I2 hyperfine components and making heterodyne difference frequency measurements on a p-in diode. This provided the frequency scale from which measurements of the frequency differences between the transitions detected by the 31},

abstract = {We investigate reactions between laser-cooled Be + ions and room-temperature water molecules using an integrated ion trap and high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This system allows simultaneous measurement of individual reaction rates that are resolved by reaction product. The rate coefficient of the Be + (2 S 1/2) + H 2 O → BeOH + + H reaction is measured for the first time and is found to be approximately two times smaller than predicted by an ion−dipole capture model. Zero-point-corrected quasi-classical trajectory calculations on a highly accurate potential energy surface for the ground electronic state reveal that the reaction is capture-dominated, but a submerged barrier in the product channel lowers the reactivity. Furthermore, laser excitation of the ions from the 2 S 1/2 ground state to the 2 P 3/2 state opens new reaction channels, and we report the rate and branching ratio of the Be + (2 P 3/2) + H 2 O → BeOH + + H and H 2 O + + Be reactions. The excited-state reactions are nonadiabatic in nature. L ow-temperature reactions of simple ions with small molecules play a central role in astrochemical environments from interstellar clouds to cometary comae to planetary atmospheres, including that of Earth. 1,2 The chemical evolution of interstellar molecular clouds ultimately yields the seedbed from which new stars and planets are born and the raw materials from which life likely developed. A firm understanding of the reaction rates for a host of elementary ion−molecule reactions is essential to accurately model these environments. Techniques such as selected ion flow tubes (SIFTs), 3 guided ion beams, 4 and supersonic flows (CRESU) 5 have improved our empirical understanding of these processes; however, each has its own limitations. 6,7 Theoretically, it has long been recognized that these ion−molecule reactions are often barrierless, and their rates are frequently described by capture models. 8 However, recent studies have revealed that dynamical features can sometimes prevail, 9−11 in which case statistical treatments may not be accurate. 12,13 Therefore, new experimental and theoretical efforts are needed to accurately address ion−molecule chemistry. We have developed an approach, adapted from the ultracold ion community, 14−16 to study reactions of atomic ions with small molecules. Here we report the use of this approach to study the reaction of Be + with gas-phase water for the first time. There have been very few experimental studies of gas-phase reactions between metal ions and water, especially at low temperature, despite their importance for metal ion chemistry in a range of environments. 17−19 Singly ionized beryllium is a particularly attractive metallic reactant to use for such studies because it is both theoretically tractable and experimentally highly controllable. The relatively simple electronic structure of this three-electron ion allows both highly accurate characterization of its electronic structure and laser cooling, 20 and the low mass of Be + lends itself to high motional frequencies as well as efficient sympathetic cooling of other chemically interesting atomic ions when employed in ion traps. 21−24 For the molecular reaction partner, H 2 O is arguably the most important molecule in chemistry, and theoretical studies of its reactions with a single atom have been reported on full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs). 25−29 Thus this system of reagents provides an opportunity to perform a high-resolution comparison between experiment and theory for a molecule−ion system. The apparatus employed here is shown in the Supporting Information (SI) (Figure S1). Laser ablation of metallic Be is used to produce Be + ions, which are trapped in a linear radio frequency Paul trap. 30 Laser cooling 31 is used to cool the translational motion of the ions, resulting in a Coulomb crystal of Be + ions.

Thus vibrational excitation can control the H+HOD reaction to produce either product almost exclusively.

Bond-selective reaction dynamics of the title reaction is investigated using full-dimensional quantum dynamical (QD) and quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) methods on a newly constructed ab initio global potential energy surface. Both QD and QCT results indicate that excitation of the local OH vibration in the HOD reactant renders the reaction strongly bond selective, with the OD/OH branching ratio in quantitative agreement with the experiment. In addition, the reactivity is found to be greatly enhanced with the reactant vibrational excitation, thanks to the change of a direct rebound mechanism to a capture mechanism. The QCT calculations also yield product state distributions, which show that the HCl product is vibrationally and rotationally hot while the OD co-product is internally cold. The bond selectivity, vibrational enhancement, and product energy disposal are rationalized by the Sudden Vector Projection model.},

The strong PAH band at 3.29 μm generally decreases exponentially with distance from the ionization front into the molecular cloud (scale height ~12''), although excesses appear ~10'' and ~20'' behind the ionization front, close to layers of H2 and CO emission, respectively. The 3.40 μm PAH feature separates into two components with very different spatial distributions. The main component (at 3.395 μm), along with the 3.51 μm band and the PAH plateau (3.3-3.6 μm), shows excess emission ~10'' and ~20'' behind the ionization front, stronger than the excesses in the 3.29 μm band. The extra component of the 3.40 μm band, which peaks at ~3.405 μm, has a spatial distribution very similar to the H2 emission. Aromatic C—H stretches in PAHs most likely produce the 3.29 μm feature. Aliphatic C—H stretches in either attached methyl sidegroups or superhydrogenated PAHs, or perhaps both, could produce the complicated spectral and spatial structure at 3.40 μm.}

The J = 2 → 1 and J = 3 → 2 lines at 179 GHz and 268 GHz have also been observed in W51 and Orion KL. In conjunction with past observations of HOC+ toward Orion KL and SgrB2 (OH) by Ziurys & Apponi, these data confirm the presence of this ion in the interstellar medium. The column densities of HOC+ were found to be Ntot ~ (7 × 1010)-(3 × 1012) cm-2, which correspond to fractional abundances of f~(2 × 10-13)-(3 × 10-12) relative to H2. Observations of the J = 1 → 0 transition of HC18O+ at 85 GHz have also been carried out, resulting in [HCO+]/[HOC+] ratios of 360-6000. These values are in good agreement with recent modeling by Herbst & Woon and confirm that the reaction of HOC+ with H2 indeed has a substantial barrier at low (T < 50 K) temperatures. The widespread abundance of HOC+ additionally suggests that there is not a strong preference for synthesis of this ion in photon-dominated regions, although there may be a small enhancement toward such gas. Finally, confirmation of interstellar HOC+ has been accomplished through observations of weak emission (TR ≲ 50 mK) at 179 GHz, proving that measurements near the atmospheric water line at 183 GHz are not as difficult as previously thought.}

On the surfaces (Av < 1−3) of interstellar clouds, the absorption of far ultraviolet (FUV) photons (hν < 13.6 eV) by gas and dust grains leads to intense emission of [C II] 158 μm, [O I] 63, 146 μm, and H2 rovibrational transitions, as well as IR dust continuum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features. Deeper in PDRs, CO rotational and [C I] 370, 609 μm lines originate. The transition of H to H2 and C+ to CO occurs within PDRs. Theoretical models compared with observations diagnose such physical parameters as the density and temperature structure, the elemental abundances, and the FUV radiation field in PDRs. Applications include clouds next to H II regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebulae, red giant outflows, circumstellar gas around young stars, diffuse clouds, the warm neutral medium (WNM), and molecular clouds in the interstellar radiation field: in summary, much of the interstellar medium in galaxies. This review focuses on dense PDRs in the Milky Way Galaxy. Theoretical PDR models help explain the observed correlation of the CO J = 1–0 luminosity with the molecular mass and also suggest FUV-induced feedback mechanisms that may regulate star formation rates and the column density through giant molecular clouds. }

Both product channels have been observed for the first time, and the branching to BeOD+ + H is found to be 0.58 ± 0.14. The experimental observation is reproduced by both quasi-classical trajectory and statistical calculations. Theoretical analyses reveal that the branching to the two product channels is largely due to the availability of open states in each channel.}

Such enhancements are caused by zero-point-energy effects that operate at the very low temperatures of interstellar clouds. The details of the fraction at ion process have been known for about 15 years but recent observations of multiply deuterated molecules including ND3 and CD3OH, with enhancements of around 1011 times the cosmic ratio, have forced us to re-examine the theory surrounding fractionation. It turns out that the theory remains secure but that these large enhancements are reflecting physical conditions in the late stages of cloud collapse when most gas-phase molecules are frozen out on to the surfaces of interstellar grains. As a result, observations of deuterated ions, such as H2D+ and D2H+, maybe the best probes of this stage in the formation of stars.},

@techreport{Bradley,
	abstract = {The design of systems for operation at cryogenic temperatures requires the use of material properties at these low temperatures. The properties at cryogenic temperatures can be much different than the room-temperature values. In addition, some properties can be strong functions of temperature. Property data at cryogenic temperatures are not easy to find. Many measurements were made at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other laboratories about 50 years ago. Some of the results were published in reports that are now out of print, which makes the results unavailable to most researchers. To correct that problem, NIST initiated a program to critically evaluate cryogenic material properties and to curve fit the available data for temperatures in the range of about 4 K to 300 K. The parameters for the curve fit, as well as a graph of the curve, are available on the website www.cryogenics.nist.gov. Click on "Material Properties" to find the list of materials. The properties available include thermal conductivity, specific heat, linear thermal expansion, thermal expansion coefficient, and Young's modulus. Not all properties are available for all materials. The materials currently in the database are ones commonly used in the construction of cryogenic hardware. The tables presented here are the calculated values using the equations given on the website. In general the equations fit a single set of data to within about 1 % to 2 %, but often several sets of data are used in determining the best fit, in which case deviations can be significantly higher, such as 5 %. The website specifies the deviation of the fit relative to the experimental data for each property and each material. Uncertainties in the experimental data usually are in the range of 2 % to 5 %, and variations from sample to sample can also lead to similar uncertainties, especially in thermal conductivity. Some well-characterized materials, such as silicon, are used for standard reference materials. Thus, uncertainties in the experimental data for the thermal expansion coefficient of silicon are usually less than 0.2 %, and the standard deviation of the curve fit to the data is less than about 0.2 % over most of the temperature range Copper referred to here is of very high purity 99.99% (4N or better) and may be considered oxygen-free (sometimes referred to as OFHC-oxygen free high conductivity). Values are given with respect to the RRR (Residual Resistivity Ratio) which correlates the thermal resistivity and electrical resistivity as the impurity effect and is primarily additive in resistivity. Higher RRR values indicate higher purity and lower electrical and thermal resistance leading to higher thermal conductivity. Standard high-purity copper such as grade 101 or 102 has an RRR value of approximately 100. Higher values may be obtained with considerable effort at minimizing trace impurities by special annealing techniques that can achieve an RRR of about 1000 or greater in some special instances. Specially obtained high RRR value copper is often used only when very low temperatures (< 40 K), and necessarily high thermal conduction at low temperature, are required. Ti 15-3-3-3 has a nominal composition of 15% V, 3% Cr, 3% Sn, 3% Al, balance Ti. For the specific measurements documented by Canavan and Tuttle (Ref. 29), the exact composition is 14.88% V, 3.13% Cr, 2.88% Sn, 3.01% Al, bal. Ti. The composition for brass is 65% Cu, 32% Zn, 3% Pb which is free machining. The composition for BeCu is 2% Be, 0.3% Co, balance Cu.},

@article{Bollinger1985,
	abstract = {An optical-optical double resonance technique has been used on beryllium ions stored in a Penning trap to measure the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction constant A$\sim$/2 of the 2p P$\sim$g2 level in Be+. The measured value of At$\sim$2=-118.6(3.6) MHz is in good agreement with theoretical calculations. The 2p P fine-structure splitting and the 2s S$\sim$/2 2p P3/2 &/2 optical transition frequencies have also been measured. The 2p P hyperfine structure of the Lit electronic sequence has attracted much theoretical interest over the past two decades (see, for example, Refs. 1-4 and references contained in Ref. 5). This is because of the computational feasibility in a three-electron system, the importance of and interest in polarization and correlation effects, and the availability of good experimental measurements in 7Li. The 3 ]/2 2 3/2 and 3 3/2 $\sim$/2 hypef inc constants of the 2p P state in 7Li have been measured; these constants determine the individual spin-dipolar, orbital, and contact contributions to the 2p P hyperfine structure. Agreement with theoretical calculations is on the order of a few percent. ' Measurements of the A3/2 hyperfine constant of the 2p P state have been made in sBe+ (Ref. 8) and "B2+ (Ref. 9). In sBe+, $\sim$23$\sim$2$\sim$ has been measured to be less than 0.6 MHz. s A Hartree-Pock central field calculation yields the value Q 3/2-=-1 8.7 MHz, but polarization and correlation effects contribute + 17.2 MHz and produce a final value of A 3/2-1 .5 (1.2) MHz in agreement with the expe'rimental measurements. ' Measurements of the A$\sim$/2 and A3/2, I/2 hy-perfine constants of the 2p P state in Be+ are useful for further tests of the theoretical calculations and are needed to determine the individual spin-dipolar, orbital, and contact contributions to the 2p P hyperfine structure. This paper reports the first measurement of the A$\sim$/2 hyperfine constant of the 2p 2P state in 9Be+. The measured value of At(2=-118. 6(3.6) MHz is in agreement with the theoretical calculation of Ref. 1 of-116.8(2.4) MHz. Much of the experimental apparatus used in this measurement has been described in other reports. ' " Be+ ions were confined by the static magnetic and electric fields of a Penning trap in ultrahigh vacuum ((10 $\sim$ Pa). The uniform magnetic field of approximately 1.1 T nearly decoupled the nuclear spin from the total electronic angular momentum. The confining electric field (1 V/cm) had a negligible perturbation (& 1 Hz) on the 2s Sip and 2p PJ energy levels of the ions. The benign environment and long confinement times of electromagnetic traps have been used to make numerous high-precision rf and microwave measurements of the hyperfine structure in the ground state of ions. ' Here, however, an optical measurement of the first excited state hyperfine structure was accomplished by using laser cooling to reduce the ion temperature below a few K so that the hyperfine components of the optical transition were resolved. A narrow-band (& 4 MHz) radiation source (power = 20 p, W) tuned to the low-frequency side of the 2s 2Stg(Mg, Mg) = (-T,-$\sim$) 2p 2P3(2(-$\sim$,-q) ()$\sim$. =313 nm) transition of Be+ was used to cool and spatially compress the ions and optically pump them into the (-T,-T) ground state. " The 313-nm source was obtained by frequency doubling the output of a single-mode cw dye laser. The resonance fluorescence induced by this "cooling" laser was used to detect the ions. " Typical ion "clouds" consisted of at most several hundred ions with cloud densities of 2X 10$\sim$ ions/cm and cloud diameters of 100-300 p, m. The 2p P&$\sim$2 hyperfine structure was measured by an optical-optical double resonance technique with a second frequency-doubled dye laser, denoted the probe laser (power &(1 p, W). '3 When the probe laser was tuned in resonance with the 2s'Si(2(-$\sim$.-$\sim$)-2p'Pig(-z. +» transition (transition A), some of the ion population was removed from the (-$\sim$,-r) ground state. This resulted in a decrease in the observed fluorescence induced by the cooling laser. The 2s 'Si)2(-$\sim$,-$\sim$)-2p 'Pi(2(-$\sim$,-$\sim$) transition (transition B) was detected in a similar way. Radio-frequency (rf) radiation (frequency approximately equal to 300 MHz) tuned to the ground-state (-T,-$\sim$) (-$\sim$,-$\sim$) transition was used to mix the (-r,-$\sim$) and (-$\sim$,-T) ground states. Owing to this rf mixing, a decrease in the fluorescent light intensity was also observed when the probe laser was tuned from the (-$\sim$,-$\sim$) ground state to the 2p Pig2(-$\sim$, + $\sim$) state (transition C). Figure 1 shows the transitions driven by the probe laser. Figure 2(a) shows the depopulation signals obtained when the probe laser was frequency swept through transitions A and C. Part of the probe dye laser beam, before doubling, was picked off and sent into an ' I2 ceil. ' I2 saturated absorption spectra were simultaneously recorded as the probe laser was frequency swept through the optical transitions to the 2p2Pig2 state (see Fig. 2). At the magnetic field used in this experiment, line number 955 of the ' I2 atlas'4 and the next higher-frequency line (uncataloged) approximately coincided with the Be+ transitions to the MJ=-$\sim$ and MJ= + $\sim$ states of the 2p-Pr$\sim$$\sim$/2 manifold, respectively. The frequency differences between the I2 hyperfine components were measured by stabilizing two dye lasers to different I2 hyperfine components and making heterodyne difference frequency measurements on a p-in diode. This provided the frequency scale from which measurements of the frequency differences between the transitions detected by the 31},

	abstract = {We have studied the spectral and spatial distribution across the Orion Bar of the 3-14 micrometers emission, including hydrogen Brackett alpha and 12.8 micrometers [Ne II] emission lines and several "dust" emission features.  The data indicate that the "dust" consists of three components; (1) "classical" dust with a temperature of approximately 60 K accounting for emission longward of 20 micrometers, (2) amorphous carbon particles or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clusters (approximately 400 C atoms) which produce broad emission features in the 6-9 and 11-13 micrometers bands, and (3) free PAHs which emit in sharper bands (most strongly at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micrometers).  The 3.3 and 11.3 micrometers features, which are due to C-H modes, are well correlated spatially, while the 7.7 micrometers band, due to C=C modes, has a different distribution than the 3.3 and 11.3 micrometers bands.  We conclude that the sharp emission bands arise in the photodissociation transition region between the H II region and the molecular cloud and are not present in the H II region.  The broad continuum feature extending from 11-13 micrometers is strong in both regions.  Previous broad-band observations of the 10 and 20 micrometers flux distributions, which show that the 10 micrometers radiation extends farther into the neutral gas to the south than the 20 micrometers radiation, suggest that some of the 10 micrometers flux is supplied via a nonthermal mechanism, such as fluorescence.},
