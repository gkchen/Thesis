The experiment has broken new ground in ion-molecule reactions at various reaction temperatures, but there is still much left unexplored. The recent inclusion of two Lioptec dye lasers will allow for more stuff and stuff.

Also stereodynamics with molecules or just atoms

We have only been exciting the \ce{Be+} into the \ce{^2P3/2} state because it is easier than the \ce{^2P1/2} manifold, but that would allow us to possibly see fine structure dependent rates and dynamics.
