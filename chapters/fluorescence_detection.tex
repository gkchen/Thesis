Ideally, having a single ion in the trap while sweeping the frequency or power would allow us to determine the saturation parameter, and thus the fraction of \ce{Be+} in the excited \ce{^2P3/2} state. Due to the size and depth of our ion trap, we cannot reliably load only one ion. On top of that, the most common residual gasses in a vacuum chamber, \ce{H2O} and \ce{H2} both readily react with \ce{Be+} in the excited state. Instead, we take images of the ions at various powers and find the fluorescence per ion to fit to a generalized form of the scatter rate ($\Gamma_d$):

\begin{align}
	\Gamma_d & = a \rho_{pp} \nonumber \\
	& = \frac{a}{2}\frac{s}{1+s+4(\delta/\Gamma)^2} \label{eq: fluor fit}
\end{align}

Where the parameter $a$ consists of all the efficiency parameters in equation \ref{eq: fluorescence efficiency}. To get the P-state fraction, \ce{Be+} ions are loaded into the trap and A-ramps are applied until a chain is formed and the laser detuning adjusted until we see maximum fluorescence on the camera, which coincides with a detuning of $\Gamma/2$. Then images of the ions are taken at various laser powers and run through a maximum filter algorithm to identify the locations of individual ions as seen in figure \ref{fig: ion image set}. The portion of the image not an ion is then averaged to obtain the background pixel value, which is then subtracted from each localized ion image. The pixel values over each localized ion is then summed to yield a total fluorescence value, which is then averaged for each image as shown in figure \ref{fig: local ions}. By fitting the collected fluorescence per ion as a function of incident power, we find the generalized efficiency $a$, revealing the P-state fraction at each power in $\rho_{pp}$, shown in figure \ref{fig: p state curve}.
