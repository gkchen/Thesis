This thesis details the development of a new platform for the interrogation of ion-molecule chemistry at cryogenic temperatures to experimentally observe reaction rates and branching ratios of fundamental reactions in the interstellar medium. By combining cryogenic buffer gas cooling, laser-cooled ion sympathetic cooling, and integrated mass spectrometry in an RF Paul trap. Cold molecular species produced in a cryogenic buffer gas beam react with trapped \ce{Be+} and \ce{C+} ions. Since charged reaction products are also trapped, ion imaging and time of flight mass spectrometry are used to study the reaction rates and identify the products. The combined apparatus gives us a method of observing nearly species agnostic ion-molecule reactions happening at collision temperatures in the range of 10 K. We found that the study of interstellar chemistry at these collision temperatures was not well explored, and an ideal avenue to explore.
