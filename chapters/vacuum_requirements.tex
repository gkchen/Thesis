To reliably laser cool and trap ions into crystals, it is ideal to have ultra-high vacuum (UHV) which is generally defined as having a pressure $<10^{-9}$ Torr. The characteristic collision rate between a monopole and polarizable neutral is defined by the $C_4/r^4$ attractive term. By considering the Langevin collision rate constant
