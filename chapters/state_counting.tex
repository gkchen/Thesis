\begin{align}
	E_{int} & = \omega_e\left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) - \omega_ex_e\left(v+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + B_ej(j+1)
\end{align}

Where $\omega_e$ is the vibrational constant, $\omega_ex_e$ is the anharmonic vibrational constant, $B_e$ is the rotational constant, and $v$, $j$ are vibrational and rotational quantum numbers respectively. You can count how many states there are up to a maximum energy input and compare states to see which product channel is preferred statistically.

To get a more accurate counting, we should be comparing the integrated states including the energy taken away by the other reactant.

\begin{align}
	\int_0^{p_{max}}4\pi p^2 n(p) dp
\end{align}

where $n(p)$ is the number of internal states allowed with momentum $p$
