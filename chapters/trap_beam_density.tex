Determining the water density in the beam at the ion trap is more difficult than in the CBGB and stem region. During normal operation of the CBGB, neither the RGA, nor the ion gauge in the trap chamber, which are off the beam axis and in a nipple, are unable to detect a change in the background water pressure. With the characterization of the \ce{Be+ + H2O} reaction pathways, we were able to validate both experimentally and theoretically, the rate constant and that it follows the ADO model (Section \ref{sec: Be+H2O}). The procedure using this method as well as subsequent results are discussed in Section \ref{sec: [HCO]}.
